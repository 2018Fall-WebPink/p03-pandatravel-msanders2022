                <li>"We went and saw Aladdin on Broadway and I must say, we were not disappointed with the venue one bit. The show was amazing and the Amsterdam Theater was everything that you would think it would be. Primitive, historic and just an abosoluely beautiful work of art mack n the middle of downtown Manhattan! We loved it!" -Michael Lehman 5 Stars in Review</li>
                <li>"Beautiful theater. The lower level is a must see. A less visited area with seating and an unbelievable ceiling. Seats are comfortable and good views from everywhere. Great spot to see a show with kids. Easy to get to by train or walking." -John Cook 5 Stars in Review</li>
